# EInk-Display
E Ink (Electronic Ink) is a display technology that mimics the appearance of ink on paper. It is primarily used in electronic paper displays (EPDs) found in e-readers, smart labels, 
digital signage, and low-power devices. Unlike traditional backlit displays, E Ink screens reflect ambient light, making them highly readable in sunlight, easy on the eyes, and extremely power-efficient.
E Ink displays use electrophoretic technology, where tiny microcapsules containing black and white particles are moved using electric fields to form visible images or text.
The display retains the image even when power is removed, enabling ultra-low power consumption. Power is only used when updating content.
